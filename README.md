# slider-project
A slider for the site was created based on the layout. This is an autonomous part that can be further implemented into the working site.  The main task is to transform the appearance of the site so that images and information about the object change on it.

The following control elements are set:
1. Arrows — switch slides in a ring. That is, after slide #3, slide #1 will open again.
2. Circles between the arrows — turn on the desired slide.
3. Links above the slider — turn on the desired slide.
